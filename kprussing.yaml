interests:
  - Keith F Prussing is at heart, a computational physicist.  Generally
    speaking, he is interested in using computers to solve complex
    physical problems.
  - His current primary field of research is simulating rendered images
    in the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
  - Keith also has an interest in large scale simulations of dynamic
    systems including simulating untracked land vehicle, aircraft, and
    sea vessel motion.
  - He also has a pet interest in radiative exchange in open
    environments.  This is relevant for predicting the temperature of a
    surface in the wider world.  Closed solutions are possible in closed
    systems where all energy is conserved, but open systems add a
    complexity because energy is allowed to escape the system.
  - Keith is also interested in methods to solve sparse, symmetric,
    block systems of equations.  His interest stems from solving heat
    equation where the energy flow is predominantly local but the
    radiative exchange couples disparate objects.  However, these types
    of systems arise from many physical systems where the dominant
    interaction is local but long range interactions influence the
    evolution of the system.
  - Essentially, he really likes figuring out how to teach computers to
    solve complex problems.
  - A side effect of his interest in complex simulations, Keith has
    developed an interest in integrating Open Source development
    practices with traditional academic pursuits.  This includes an
    interest in building and distributing software with tools such as
    autotools, CMake, SCons, latexmk, and Python's setuptools.
  - Keith takes a strong interest in teaching any and all who will
    listen about the practices of Open Source development, including
    reproducible builds and execution, version control, and
    documentation, and how to implement them in computation science and
    engineering.
  - Keith really enjoys figuring out how to make computers “do the right
    thing.”  He really enjoys writing code or documentation, running a
    “compile” command, watching text scroll across his terminal, and
    then reveling in final product.
  - Keith really enjoys exploring document typesetting using LaTeX and
    its affiliated tools like TikZ.
  - Keith is a strong supporter of Open Source practices and actively
    participates in discussions on a number of different Open Source
    tools and tries to contribute changes to the projects when able.
  - Keith is an educator who likes to promulgate how and why infrared is
    a viable band in which to do detection.  As such he administers the
    Infrared and Visible Signature Suppression short course and teaches
    the Infrared Search and Track session of the Target Tracking Systems
    short course for the Georgia Tech Professional Education division.

key-delivered-products:
# Products are tangible things delivered to the sponsor community which
# then provide utility to the external community for an extended period.
# Identify the key products or systems delivered to which the candidate
# made substantial contributions, including hardware, software code,
# contributions to public works, etc.  This should not simply be a
# repeat of the projects performed by the candidate.  Attach copies of
# sponsor testimonials where possible to document the impacts achieved.
# NOTE: IRAD efforts do not go here unless they are a special case with
# significant external dissemination and received some type of
# recognition/award for the effort from an organization external to
# Georgia Tech.

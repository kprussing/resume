interests:
  - Teaching computers to solve complex physical problems.
  - Rendering images in the visible and infrared regions of the
    electromagnetic spectrum.
  - Large scale simulations of dynamic systems including simulating
    untracked land vehicle, aircraft, and sea vessel motion.

    in complex environments.
  - Methods to solve sparse, symmetric, block systems of non-linear
    equations like those associated with heat transfer.
  - Integrating Open Source development practices with traditional
    academic pursuits.
  - Applying Open Sources methods to develop methods for creating
    reproducible results and teaching these methods to other researchers.
  - Methods to transform “simple,” easy to write plain text
    documentation to formally typeset documentation.
  - Teaching all and sundry how and why infrared and visible detection
    are are critical bands in to model and simulate.

# Products are tangible things delivered to the sponsor community which
# then provide utility to the external community for an extended period.
# Identify the key products or systems delivered to which the candidate
# made substantial contributions, including hardware, software code,
# contributions to public works, etc.  This should not simply be a
# repeat of the projects performed by the candidate.  Attach copies of
# sponsor testimonials where possible to document the impacts achieved.
# NOTE: IRAD efforts do not go here unless they are a special case with
# significant external dissemination and received some type of
# recognition/award for the effort from an organization external to
# Georgia Tech.

    product: >-
        The Fortran implementation of GTRI's multihypothesis tracking
        algorithm.

    product: >-
        A library for computing atmospheric transmittance and path
        radiance for use within the Georgia Tech Simulation Integrated
        Modeling System.  The core methods in the library wrap calls
        to MODTRAN, the DoD standard utility for calculating atmospheric
        corrections, to perform the calculations and extract the
        relevant results.
    contribution: >-
        Upgraded the MODTRAN version used by the GTSIMS atmospheric
        library and unified all usage by the components of GTSIMS.  This
        included updating the internals to call the MODTRAN executable
        using the standard Fortran 2008 methods instead of modifying the
        provided source increasing the fidelity of the model.  He also
        updated all portions of the GTSIMS suite that used various older
        versions of MODTRAN that had been partially updated with code
        from newer versions of MODTRAN.

        A Fortran module to load an arbitrary beam profile into
        Ignition3D, a custom 3D heat transfer program for high energy
        laser lethality modeling.  The module provides a means to model
        an arbitrary beam profile derived from measured data to
        correctly simulate the heat transfer during high energy laser
        lethality testing.
    contribution: >-
        Developed the module and defined the interface.

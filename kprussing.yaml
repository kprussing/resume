interests:
  - Teaching computers to solve complex physical problems.
  - Rendering images in the visible and infrared regions of the
    electromagnetic spectrum.
  - Large scale simulations of dynamic systems including simulating
    untracked land vehicle, aircraft, and sea vessel motion.
  - Radiative exchange in open environments to understand energy balance
    in complex environments.
  - Methods to solve sparse, symmetric, block systems of non-linear
    equations like those associated with heat transfer.
  - Integrating Open Source development practices with traditional
    academic pursuits.
  - Applying Open Sources methods to develop methods for creating
    reproducible results and teaching these methods to other researchers.
  - Methods to transform “simple,” easy to write plain text
    documentation to formally typeset documentation.
  - Teaching all and sundry how and why infrared and visible detection
    are are critical bands in to model and simulate.

key-delivered-products:
# Products are tangible things delivered to the sponsor community which
# then provide utility to the external community for an extended period.
# Identify the key products or systems delivered to which the candidate
# made substantial contributions, including hardware, software code,
# contributions to public works, etc.  This should not simply be a
# repeat of the projects performed by the candidate.  Attach copies of
# sponsor testimonials where possible to document the impacts achieved.
# NOTE: IRAD efforts do not go here unless they are a special case with
# significant external dissemination and received some type of
# recognition/award for the effort from an organization external to
# Georgia Tech.

    product: >-
        The Fortran implementation of GTRI's multihypothesis tracking
        algorithm.
    contribution: >-
        Prussing ported the MATLAB implementation of the multihypothesis
        tracking algorithm into Fortran so it would work natively with
        Suppressor instead of running on side products.

    product: >-
        A library for computing atmospheric transmittance and path
        radiance for use within the Georgia Tech Simulation Integrated
        Modeling System.  The core methods in the library wrap calls
        to MODTRAN, the DoD standard utility for calculating atmospheric
        corrections, to perform the calculations and extract the
        relevant results.
    contribution: >-
        Prussing upgraded the MODTRAN version used by the GTSIMS
        atmospheric library and unified all usage by the components of
        GTSIMS.  This included updating the internals to call the
        MODTRAN executable using the standard Fortran 2008 methods
        instead of modifying the provided source increasing the fidelity
        of the model.  He also updated all portions of the GTSIMS suite
        that used various older versions of MODTRAN that had been
        partially updated with code from newer versions of MODTRAN.

        A suite of tools for working with measurements from high energy
        laser lethality testing to extract temperature and emissivity
        values for the materials under consideration.
    contribution: >-
        Developed all 2000 lines of the toolbox.

    product: >-
        A Fortran module to load an arbitrary beam profile into
        Ignition3D, a custom 3D heat transfer program for high energy
        laser lethality modeling.  The module provides a means to model
        an arbitrary beam profile derived from measured data to
        correctly simulate the heat transfer during high energy laser
        lethality testing.
    contribution: >-
        Prussing developed the full module and defined the interface.

    product: >-
        A package for aiding in marking classified documents in LaTeX.
        The goal of the project is to allow the user to mark regions of
        their document with syntactic macros and allow LaTeX to handle
        determine the correct markings for each page and the overall
        classification of the document.
    contribution: >-
        Prussing devised and implemented the entire package and is the
        current maintainer of the package.  This includes devising the
        methodology for tracking the current classification level of the
        current block of text and the highest level of classification
        noted on the current page.

        packet so that future formatting changes become trivial.

interests:
  - >-
      Keith F Prussing is at heart, a computational physicist.
      Generally speaking, he is interested in using computers to solve
      complex physical problems.
  - >-
      His current primary field of research is simulating rendered
      images in the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic
      spectrum.  \todo{Figure out a way to spin as multi-spectral image
      modeling.}
  - >-
      Keith also has an interest in large scale simulations of dynamic
      systems including simulating untracked land vehicle, aircraft, and
      sea vessel motion.
  - >-
      He also has a pet interest in radiative exchange in open
      environments.  This is relevant for predicting the temperature of
      a surface in the wider world.  Closed solutions are possible in
      closed systems where all energy is conserved, but open systems add
      a complexity because energy is allowed to escape the system.
  - >-
      Keith is also interested in methods to solve sparse, symmetric,
      block systems of equations.  His interest stems from solving heat
      equation where the energy flow is predominantly local but the
      radiative exchange couples disparate objects.  However, these
      types of systems arise from many physical systems where the
      dominant interaction is local but long range interactions
      influence the evolution of the system.
  - >-
      Essentially, he really likes figuring out how to teach computers
      to solve complex problems.
  - >-
      A side effect of his interest in complex simulations, Keith has
      developed an interest in integrating Open Source development
      practices with traditional academic pursuits.  This includes an
      interest in building and distributing software with tools such as
      autotools, CMake, SCons, latexmk, and Python's setuptools.
  - >-
      Keith takes a strong interest in teaching any and all who will
      listen about the practices of Open Source development, including
      reproducible builds and execution, version control, and
      documentation, and how to implement them in computation science
      and engineering.
  - >-
      Keith really enjoys figuring out how to make computers “do the
      right thing.”  He really enjoys writing code or documentation,
      running a “compile” command, watching text scroll across his
      terminal, and then reveling in final product.
  - >-
      Keith really enjoys exploring document typesetting using LaTeX and
      its affiliated tools like TikZ.
  - >-
      Keith is a strong supporter of Open Source practices and actively
      participates in discussions on a number of different Open Source
      tools and tries to contribute changes to the projects when able.
  - >-
      Keith is an educator who likes to promulgate how and why infrared
      is a viable band in which to do detection.  As such he administers
      the Infrared and Visible Signature Suppression short course and
      teaches the Infrared Search and Track session of the Target
      Tracking Systems short course for the Georgia Tech Professional
      Education division.

key-delivered-products:
# Products are tangible things delivered to the sponsor community which
# then provide utility to the external community for an extended period.
# Identify the key products or systems delivered to which the candidate
# made substantial contributions, including hardware, software code,
# contributions to public works, etc.  This should not simply be a
# repeat of the projects performed by the candidate.  Attach copies of
# sponsor testimonials where possible to document the impacts achieved.
# NOTE: IRAD efforts do not go here unless they are a special case with
# significant external dissemination and received some type of
# recognition/award for the effort from an organization external to

    product: >-
        The Fortran implementation of GTRI's multihypothesis tracking
        algorithm.  \todo{Check out Rick's description for more details}
    contribution: >-
        Prussing ported the MATLAB implementation of the multihypothesis
        tracking algorithm into Fortran so it would work natively with
        Suppressor instead of running on side products.

    product: >-
        A library for computing atmospheric transmittance and path
        radiance for use within the Georgia Tech Simulation Integrated
        Modeling System.  The core methods in the library wrap calls
        to MODTRAN, the DoD standard utility for calculating atmospheric
        corrections, to perform the calculations and extract the
        relevant results.
    contribution: >-
        Prussing upgraded the MODTRAN version used by the GTSIMS
        atmospheric library and unified all usage by the components of
        GTSIMS.  This included updating the internals to call the
        MODTRAN executable using the standard Fortran 2008 methods
        instead of modifying the provided source increasing the fidelity
        of the model.  He also updated all portions of the GTSIMS suite
        that used various older versions of MODTRAN that had been
        partially updated with code from newer versions of MODTRAN.

        A suite of tools for working with measurements from high energy
        laser lethality testing to extract temperature and emissivity
        values for the materials under consideration.
    contribution: >-
        Developed all 2000 lines of the toolbox.

    product: >-
        A Fortran module to load an arbitrary beam profile into
        Ignition3D, a custom 3D heat transfer program for high energy
        laser lethality modeling.  The module provides a means to model
        an arbitrary beam profile derived from measured data to
        correctly simulate the heat transfer during high energy laser
        lethality testing.
    contribution: >-
        Prussing developed the full module and defined the interface.

        A package for aiding in marking classified documents in LaTeX.
        The goal of the project is to allow the user to mark regions of
        their document with syntactic macros and allow LaTeX to handle
        determine the correct markings for each page and the overall
        classification of the document.
    contribution: >-
        Prussing devised and implemented the entire package and is the
        current maintainer of the package.  This includes devising the
        methodology for tracking the current classification level of the
        current block of text and the highest level of classification
        noted on the current page.

abstract: DSIAC subject matter experts performed a search of the open literature
  to locate new research pertaining to visible, infrared, and thermal signature
  management. The search focused on developments since 2018, when a previous summary
  was provided. Areas covered include manipulation of emissivity; reflectivity;
  adsorption; refraction and backscatter using multispectral camouflage materials;
  multilayered, cavity-coupled plasmonic systems; metamaterials; nanoparticles;
  carbon nanotubes; glass microspheres; nanofibers; electrochromatic fabric; metasurfaces;
  waveguides; and lenticular lens materials.

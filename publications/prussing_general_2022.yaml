abstract: One major struggle for modeling and simulation (M and S) over the past decades
  has been the development of individual models in isolation. Typically, models are
  developed for a single application area where they tend to become domain specific
  as the complexity of a single model grows. When a future application requires interaction
  of multiple M and S approaches that have developed independently, it is difficult,
  if not impossible, for the models to integrate into a common environment. Furthering
  this difficulty is that the models have likely developed disparate concepts of the
  world in which they operate. A prime example of this effect is the development of
  infrared (IR) and radio frequency (RF) models, which have different large scale
  phenomenology and have, therefore, developed as separate M and S domains. Attempting
  to combine the two modalities through integration of existing M and S tools specific
  to each application domain has historically proven nigh impossible. These factors
  led to the development of the Dynamic Model Integration and Simulation Engine (DMISE)
  which provides a flexible and extensible framework for integration of different
  models into a common simulation by defining the interfaces for the simulation components.
  For multi-spectral IR and RF simulations, the General High-Fidelity Omni-Spectral
  Toolbox (GHOST) has been built on the DMISE framework to allow for integration of
  models across the electromagnetic spectrum. This paper presents GHOST and the status
  of the current effort to provide a true multi-spectral, multi-sensor, and multi-actor
  M and S environment through simulation of scenarios with combined IR and RF sensors
  operating in a common environment.

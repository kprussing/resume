abstract: Stellar Science and Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) developed the
  initial prototype of a new software architecture named the Realistic Image and Neighborhood
  Generator (RING). RING provides an interface through which a wide variety of image
  and rendering software can run and interact with other codes. The RING prototype
  provides initial scene generation capabilities by incorporating Stellar Science's
  Abstract Model Interface (AMI) ray tracing software and the state-of-the-art cloud
  radiance profiles generated by open source tools used in GTRI's Georgia Tech Simulations
  Integrated Modeling System (GTSIMS) cloud rendering pipeline.

  Provided detailed description of background temperature modeling and
  how to integrate into the sponsor's rendering pipeline.  Also provided
  description of ocean reflectance modeling, ocean surface state
  modeling, and aerodynamic heating.  Researched and detailed further
  potential enhancements to the cloud rendering process developed under
  Phase I of this STTR.

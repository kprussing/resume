abstract: Georgia Tech has investigated methods for the detection and tracking of
  personnel in a variety of acquisition environments. This research effort focused
  on a detailed phenomenological analysis of human physiology and signatures with
  the subsequent identification and characterization of potential observables. Both
  aspects are needed to support the development of personnel detection and tracking
  algorithms. As a fundamental part of this research effort, Georgia Tech collected
  motion capture data on an individual for a variety of walking speeds, carrying
  loads, and load distributions. These data formed the basis for deriving fundamental
  properties of the individualâ€™s motion and the derivation of motionbased observables,
  and changes in these fundamental properties arising from load variations. Analyses
  were conducted to characterize the motion properties of various body components
  such as leg swing, arm swing, head motion, and full body motion. This paper will
  describe the data acquisition process, extraction of motion characteristics, and
  analysis of these data. Video sequences illustrating the motion data and analysis
  results will also be presented.
note: Aided in signature model for human body and performed data reduction and analysis.

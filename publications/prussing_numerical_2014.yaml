abstract: It is well known that the radiative transport between particles, particularly
  the case of nano-sized particles, can exceed the black body limit when the separation
  between the particles less than the thermal wavelength λ\_T∼hc\\/(k\_B T). This
  energy exchange can drastically affect the temperature profile of a system. The
  ability to influence the temperature profile of a system has applications in microprocessor
  design and thermophotovoltaic cell efficiency. Recent work has shown that the
  temperature dependence of a system of dipoles is influenced by the configuration.
  Other work has demonstrated a methodology to investigate the total flux into closely
  separated bodies using the boundary element method. This computational method
  permits the insertion of test surfaces into the two-body system to readily assess
  the directionality of the electromagnetic flux at additional points in space.
  By studying the effect of particle shape and orientation of the flux through such
  a test surface, it will be possible to establish geometric configurations to directionally
  channel the electromagnetic flux through a system of particles. In this poster,
  we outline the methodology to compute the flux distribution and consider the flux
  in the initial case between a sphere and a spheroid as a function of eccentricity.

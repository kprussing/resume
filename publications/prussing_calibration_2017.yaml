    Provided detailed description of how to perform high temperature
    measurement using multiple infrared cameras including theoretical
    background on radiative transfer with regard to heat transfer.
    Included 2,000 lines of MATLAB code to generate calibration files
    for use with customer's processing software and process
    measurements to determine temperature during measurements.

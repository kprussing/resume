abstract: 'A key component of a night scene background on a clear moonless night
  is the stellar background. Celestial objects affected by atmospheric distortions
  and optical system noise become the primary contribution of clutter for detection
  and tracking algorithms while at the same time providing a solid geolocation or
  time reference due to their highly predictable motion. Any detection algorithm
  that needs to operate on a clear night must take into account the stellar background
  and remove it via background subtraction methods. As with any scenario, the ability
  to develop detection algorithms depends on the availability of representative
  data to evaluate the difficulty of the task. Further, the acquisition of measured
  field data under arbitrary atmospheric conditions is difficult if not impossible.
  For this reason, a radiometrically accurate simulation of the stellar background
  is a boon to algorithm developers. To aid in simulating the night sky, we have
  incorporated a star-field rendering model into the Georgia Tech Simulations Integrated
  Modeling System (GTSIMS). Rendering a radiometrically accurate star-field requires
  three major components: positioning the stars as a function of time and observer
  location, determining the in-band radiance of each star, and simulating the apparent
  size of each star. We present the models we have incorporated into GTSIMS and
  provide a representative sample of the images generated with the new model. We
  then demonstrate how the clutter in the neighborhood of a pixels change by including
  a radiometrically accurate rendering of a star-field.'

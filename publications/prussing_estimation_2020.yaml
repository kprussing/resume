abstract: With the ever-growing number of resident space objects (RSOs) surrounding
  the Earth, it is imperative that we develop techniques for determining their current
  and future state by leveraging a collection of radio frequency and optical observations
  to maintain space domain awareness (SDA). The state of an RSO at a future time
  is determined by its current state and the forces acting upon it. In theory, this
  prediction is trivial; however, knowing all of the forces is not practical. When
  a space object undergoes a maneuver, this simple extrapolation fails, and more
  measurements are required before an updated state estimate would be available
  causing tracking methods to fail. One means by which an RSO undergoes a maneuver,
  is by firing its thruster which provides a transient component to its signature.
  For example, many small satellites use Hall effect thrusters to perform station
  keeping. The emission from these thrusters can be up to three times greater than
  the rest of the satellite. This change in the signature provides information about
  the aspect of the RSO and the amount of energy expended by the engine to produce
  a thrust on the object. This information can be passed back to the state estimators
  to reduce the time necessary to update the RSOâ€™s state. In this paper, we present
  a model for estimating the upper bound of the signature change of an RSO due to
  thruster engagement. We then present our initial results of a rendered model both
  with and without a plume present.

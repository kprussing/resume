abstract: Though many materials behave approximately as greybodies across the long-wave
  infrared (LWIR) waveband, certain important infrared (IR) scene modeling materials
  such as brick and galvanized steel exhibit more complex optical properties1. Accurately
  describing how non-greybody materials interact relies critically on the accurate
  incorporation of the emissive and reflective properties of the in-scene materials.
  Typically, measured values are obtained and used. When measured using a non-imaging
  spectrometer, a given material’s spectral emissivity requires more than one collection
  episode, as both the sample under test and a standard must be measured separately.
  In the interval between episodes changes in environment degrade emissivity measurement
  accuracy. While repeating and averaging measurements of the standard and sample
  helps mitigate such effects, a simultaneous measurement of both can ensure identical
  environmental conditions during the measurement process, thus reducing inaccuracies
  and delivering a temporally accurate determination of background or ‘down-welling’
  radiation. We report on a method for minimizing temporal inaccuracies in sample
  emissivity measurements. Using a LWIR hyperspectral imager, a Telops Hyper-Cam2,
  an approach permitting hundreds of simultaneous, calibrated spectral radiance
  measurements of the sample under test as well as a diffuse gold standard is described.
  In addition, we describe the data reduction technique to exploit these measurements.
  Following development of the reported method, spectral reflectance data from 10
  samples of various materials of interest were collected. These data are presented
  along with comments on how such data will enhance the fidelity of computer models
  of IR scenes.

abstract: Georgia Tech has investigated methods for the detection and tracking of
  personnel in a variety of acquisition environments. This research effort focused
  on a detailed phenomenological analysis of human physiology and signatures with
  the subsequent identification and characterization of potential observables. As
  a fundamental part of this research effort, Georgia Tech collected motion capture
  data on an individual for a variety of walking speeds, carrying loads, and load
  distributions. These data formed the basis for deriving fundamental properties
  of the individualâ€™s motion and supported the development of a physiologically-based
  human motion model. Subsequently this model aided the derivation and analysis
  of motion-based observables, particularly changes in the motion of various body
  components resulting from load variations. This paper will describe the data acquisition
  process, development of the human motion model, and use of the model in the observable
  analysis. Video sequences illustrating the motion data and modeling results will
  also be presented.

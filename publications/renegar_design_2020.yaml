title: Design of Experiments to Verify Photometric Models of Resident Space Objects

abstract: >-
  One fundamental problem limiting efforts to apply machine learning to
  optical space situational awareness applications is the lack of truth data to
  train algorithms. If an algorithm is to estimate the size, composition, and orientation
  of an unknown resident space object (RSO) from its light curve, it must first
  be trained using many thousands of images of RSOs for which these parameters,
  among others, are known. The availability of labeled truth data is a significant
  limiting factor, as these parameters cannot be known for debris, which comprises
  more than 70% of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) catalog.
  Additionally, smallsats are rarely characterized before launch, and even if this
  data is collected for larger satellites, it is not generally available to the
  public. One approach to this problem is to train algorithms with simulated data.
  However, this approach merely reduces the scale of the problem, since those simulations
  must be validated. We propose an experimental framework to address the question
  of how to validate optical and near-infrared (IR) simulations of RSOs viewed from
  the Earth’s surface. We explore the measurement space of both pre-launch characterizations
  of RSOs and terrestrial observations of RSOs and identify measurements that are
  most beneficial in terms of validating photometric models of RSOs. We present
  specific techniques to measure a smallsat’s bidirectional reflectance distribution
  function (BRDF) and spectral response in the laboratory, with particular attention
  to different materials on the spacecraft. We also discuss observational techniques
  for taking calibrated photometric measurements of orbiting RSOs. It is hoped that
  this framework will encourage optical and near-IR characterization of smallsats
  prior to launch, allowing for the development of a network of well-characterized
  observation targets on-orbit.

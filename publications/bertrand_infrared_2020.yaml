title: Infrared search and track with unbalanced optimal transport dynamics regularization

note: 'Conference Name: IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters'
abstract: Accurate detection of small and dim targets in infrared imagery is a crucial
  component in infrared search and track which has broad utility in military and
  remote sensing applications. Low-rank models have enjoyed state-of-the-art performance
  in infrared tracking applications, but many approaches underutilize dynamics information
  which has the potential to improve performance in challenging tracking scenarios.
  We present two algorithms, robust principal components analysis with patched unbalanced
  optimal transport (RPCA + PUOT) and robust alignment by sparse and low-rank with
  patched unbalanced optimal transport (RASL + PUOT), which incorporate optimal
  transport dynamics regularization and demonstrate improved performance on realistic
  data.

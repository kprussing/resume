# My Resume

This is the raw source for my resume along with the scrips for
processing my the source to the final form.  Some of the scripts operate
in a method to process information specific to my work into a format
they desire for the promotion process.  The rest are simply to generate
the web version of my resume.

## Scripts

The scripts are stored as a Python package.  The general form of running
the scripts is

    python3 -m projects.<script> ...

Use the `-h` option to figure out what each one does.  The evolution of
the tools is ongoing so just run the help to figure out what they do.
